# RapSquare
RapSquare An attempt at making a one-page website purely on custom CSS.  The idea behind this website was to create a platform that would fully cater to those that have a deep interest in HipHop music. It also allowed me to practice on the CSS that I know. I was able to bring that knowledge together and create this responsive one-page website.
